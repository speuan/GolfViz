My first upload to GitHub!

Created this program to help a golf course predict the distribution of golf shots if they moved the tee box. They are having problems with golf balls flying in to their neighbours properties!



The fgh & t keys move the overlay coarsely left, down, right, up.
The asd & w keys move overlay finely left, down, right, up.
The k & l keys rotate the overlay.

Once its in place you can push "p" to save an image of what you can see.

Let me know if it works!
